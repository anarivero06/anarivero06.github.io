> I was born in Venezuela and moved to the United States at a very young age. I grew up in Florida, in a diverse community with a strong immigrant presence. Despite the distance, I maintained a close relationship with my family in Venezuela, continuing to learn about my culture and stay connected to my roots. My grandmother, an artist, played a big role in inspiring my love for the arts. Now, Iâ€™m on a journey to find my place in the art world and discover what truly fuels my passion.
